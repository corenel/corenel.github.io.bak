# Logistic Regression

## Classification

* Calssification Problem
  * $y\in {0,1}$
    * 0: "Negative Class",  负类
    * 1: "Positive Class", 正类
  * One method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. This method doesn't work well because classification is not actually a linear function.
* Logistic Regression (逻辑回归) : $0\le h_\theta \le 1$
