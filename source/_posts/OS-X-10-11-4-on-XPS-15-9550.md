Thanks to the [guide](http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-wip-dell-xps-15-9550-skylake-gtx960m-ssd-via-clover-uefi.192598/) and its participants, I successfully installed OS X 10.11.4 on my XPS 15 9550.

The guide is considerably perfect. Just follow the steps and youâ€™ll get a well-done Hackintosh.

My Clover directory, DSDT & SSDT and Kexts are uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/corenel/XPS9550-OSX), for reference only.
